In this circuit, we’ll be reading in one of the most common and simple inputs – a push button – by using a digital input. Just like the LED, the push button is a basic component that is used in almost everything. The way a push button works with your Photon is that when the button is pushed, the voltage goes LOW. You Photon reads this and reacts accordingly. RedBoard Photon has internal pull-ups resistor, which keeps the voltage HIGH when you’re not pressing the button.
